# OLYMPIC
This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.
More than 35,000 medals have been awarded at the Olympics since 1896.The first two Olympiads awarded silver medals and an olive wreath for the winner, and the IOC retrospectively awarded gold, silver, and bronze to athletes based on their rankings.
This dataset provides an opportunity to ask questions about how the Olympics have evolved over time, including questions about the participation and performance of different nations, and different sports and events.
I have tried to find some answers (such as "Which country won the most gold, most silver, most bronze medals and the most medals in each olympic games?",
"What are the top 5 most successful countries in olympics?")
I have taken dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results
